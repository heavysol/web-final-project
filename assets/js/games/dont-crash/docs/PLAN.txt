Plan for endless runner

Game: simple endless runner game, with a red car controlled by the player - henceforth 'chara' - driving on a motorway across a stright horizonal invisible plane on the bottom width of the game screen it can move left to right freely within. Other cars - henceforth 'obstacles' or 'obs' - descend from the top of the screen on the motorway that'll end the game if chara collides with one. Other objs are on the road, like mud puddles and shields, that chara can touch and be changed in some way: the former'll will make chara's left-right movement slower, and the latter will enable chara to take an extra hit from obs sans game over.

Game loop
1. In the beginning of the game, chara is positioned in the middle lane of the 3 lanes available for it t'move to at any time at the bottom of the screen 

2. Obstacles - henceforth ob - are generated, randomly positioned in any of the 3 lanes at the top of the screen, and move to the bottom within their assigned lane where chara is

3. IF an ob touches chara: go to 4
ELSE: Go t'2

4. Game over screen; player has choice t'restart game
IF player restarts game: go to 1
